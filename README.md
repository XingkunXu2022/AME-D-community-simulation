# AME-D-community-simulation
- This project contains the source code from the manuscript *Heterogeneity of CH4-derived carbon induced by the O2:CH4 mediates bacterial community assembly processes.*
- Document ended with **\_main.R** is the main R script for the community simulation. Those ended simply with **.R** are required functions. Document  ended with  **.RData** is required dataset. Those ended with **.png** are the visualization results for the simulation.
